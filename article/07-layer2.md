# Layer 2 Solutions on Ethereum: A Comprehensive Guide

## 1. Introduction: What is Layer 2?

**Layer 2 (L2)** refers to technologies built on top of the Ethereum mainnet (Layer 1) to improve scalability, reduce transaction fees, and enhance throughput while inheriting Ethereum's security guarantees.

> **Definition**  
> Layer 2 is a secondary framework or protocol that operates atop the Ethereum blockchain (Layer 1), designed to offload computation, reduce congestion, and optimize transaction costs while ensuring security through anchoring on Layer 1.

## 2. Historical Background

| Year | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 2017 | CryptoKitties congested Ethereum â†’ scalability issues emerge. |
| 2018 | Plasma introduced (Vitalik & Joseph Poon). |
| 2019 | State Channels gain traction for off-chain payments. |
| 2020 | Rollups (ZK-Rollups & Optimistic Rollups) proposed as superior L2 solutions. |
| 2021 | Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync deploy first production L2s. |
| 2022-2023 | Surge of Layer 2 adoption post-Merge (EIP-4844 in sight). |

## 3. How Layer 2 Works on Ethereum

### 3.1 Key Components

| Component | Role in Layer 2 |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** | Execution environment for smart contracts, Layer 2 solutions aim for EVM compatibility (e.g., Arbitrum One, Optimism) for seamless integration. |
| **Solidity** | Primary smart contract language; L2s require L1 contracts written in Solidity for fraud proofs, state commitments, and bridging logic. |
| **Gas Costs** | L2 reduces gas per transaction significantly by batching many transactions into single L1 commitments. |
| **Deployment Process** | Involves deploying L1 smart contracts (bridges, fraud proofs) and corresponding L2 infrastructure (sequencers, aggregators, provers). |

## 4. Types of Layer 2 Solutions

| Type                   | Mechanism                                             | Examples             | Trade-offs                                             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **State Channels**     | Off-chain transactions with occasional L1 settlement. | Raiden, Connext      | Low latency, limited to specific use cases.            |
| **Plasma**             | Hierarchical chains with periodic L1 checkpoints.     | OMG Network (legacy) | High throughput, exit challenges.                      |
| **Optimistic Rollups** | Assume validity, challenge via fraud proofs.          | Optimism, Arbitrum   | Lower cost, challenge period latency (7 days).         |
| **ZK-Rollups**         | Use zero-knowledge proofs for validity.               | zkSync, StarkNet     | Fast finality, computationally intensive provers.      |
| **Validiums**          | Off-chain data availability, ZK-proofed execution.    | Immutable X          | Scalable, depends on external data availability layer. |
