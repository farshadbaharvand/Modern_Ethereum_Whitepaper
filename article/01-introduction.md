What Is Ethereum?
Ethereum is a type of blockchain‚Äîa decentralized digital network where computers around the world work together to store data and agree on its state. But unlike Bitcoin, which was designed mainly for sending and storing digital currency, Ethereum is designed to be a global computer: a platform where users can build and run applications that no single entity controls.

At the core of Ethereum is a special program called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It works like a global operating system that anyone can use. Developers can write and upload small pieces of code called smart contracts, which run automatically when certain conditions are met. These contracts are stored and executed on the blockchain, so no one can change or shut them down once they‚Äôre deployed.

Why Ethereum Was Created?
Bitcoin was the first decentralized currency, but it had a very limited scripting language‚Äîonly allowing simple functions like sending coins or checking balances. Ethereum was created in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin to overcome these limitations. It allows for programmable logic on the blockchain, enabling decentralized applications (dApps) like:

Financial tools (e.g., lending platforms)

Games that run entirely on-chain

Identity and voting systems

Key Concepts Explained
üîê Blockchain
A blockchain is a digital ledger made up of blocks, each containing a list of transactions. Each block is linked to the one before it using cryptographic hashes, forming a secure chain. This structure makes it nearly impossible to tamper with the data once added.

üß† Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are programs that run automatically on Ethereum. They execute code exactly as written, without any possibility of censorship, downtime, or third-party interference. For example, a smart contract can be written to automatically transfer money from one user to another if certain conditions are met.

üßÆ Turing-Complete
Ethereum‚Äôs programming capabilities are Turing-complete, meaning you can write any logic you want‚Äîloops, conditions, storage‚Äîjust like a normal programming language (e.g., Python or JavaScript). This allows for much more complex applications than Bitcoin.

‚ö° Decentralized
Ethereum is decentralized, which means there‚Äôs no central server or company running it. Instead, thousands of independent computers (called nodes) around the world run Ethereum software and maintain the blockchain together.

Ethereum‚Äôs Major Upgrade: The Merge
Originally, Ethereum used a system called Proof-of-Work (PoW) to secure its network. This system required miners to use powerful computers to solve complex math problems. While effective, it was energy-intensive and less scalable.

In September 2022, Ethereum underwent a major upgrade called The Merge. This switched its consensus mechanism to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Instead of mining, now users can lock up (stake) their ETH coins to help secure the network. In return, they earn rewards. This upgrade reduced Ethereum's energy usage by more than 99% and paved the way for future scaling solutions.

What This Article Will Cover
This article aims to modernize and simplify the original Ethereum whitepaper. It is written for readers who have a technical or academic background but are new to blockchain. Each section will explain how Ethereum works under the hood, including:

The math and logic behind smart contracts and consensus

How gas fees and transactions are managed

What changed in the network after The Merge

How Ethereum is evolving to support millions of users

You‚Äôll also see real-world examples, diagrams, code snippets (in Solidity), and links to Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) where changes are formally proposed and documented.
