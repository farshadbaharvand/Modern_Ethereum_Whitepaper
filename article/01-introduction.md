# 1. Introduction
# A Brief History of Money

Money, at its core, is a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Its evolution reflects human innovation in organizing economies and societies.

## 1. Barter Economy (~10,000 BCE)

Before money, societies engaged in barter—the direct exchange of goods and services.

**Problems**
- Double coincidence of wants: Both parties had to want what the other offered.
- No standardized unit of value.
- Difficult to store wealth over time.

## 2. Commodity Money (~3000 BCE onward)

People began using universally accepted items with intrinsic value (e.g., cattle, grain, shells, salt, and eventually metals) as commodity money.

**Key Development**
- Use of precious metals like gold and silver.
- Durable, divisible, portable, and relatively scarce.

## 3. Metallic Coinage (~600 BCE)

Lydia (Asia Minor) is credited with producing the first standardized coins made of electrum (gold-silver alloy).

**Benefits**
- Uniform weight and purity enabled easier trade.
- Enhanced trust in transactions.

## 4. Paper Money (China ~7th Century CE)

- Tang Dynasty used promissory notes; Song Dynasty later issued the world’s first government-backed paper currency.
- Marco Polo famously observed paper money during his travels to Yuan China in the 13th century.

**Advantages**
- Easier to transport large sums.
- Encouraged long-distance trade and early banking systems.

**Drawbacks**
- Required trust in issuer (usually the state).
- Vulnerable to overissuance and inflation.

## 5. Banking and Bills of Exchange (Medieval Europe)

Italian city-states developed banking systems and bills of exchange to facilitate trade across distances without moving physical coins.

- Beginning of representative money: paper or notes that could be exchanged for real assets.

## 6. The Gold Standard (19th Century – 20th Century)

Nations pegged their currencies to a fixed amount of gold.

**Created:**
- Stable international trade.
- Limited inflation.

**Collapse**
- World Wars I & II disrupted gold reserves.
- 1971: U.S. President Nixon ended dollar convertibility to gold, ending the Bretton Woods system.

## 7. Fiat Money (20th Century – Present)

Today’s national currencies (e.g., USD, EUR, JPY) are fiat currencies: issued by governments, not backed by physical commodities.

**Features**
- Value is based on trust in the issuing government and monetary policy.
- Central banks manage supply and interest rates (e.g., Federal Reserve, ECB).

## 8. Digital and Electronic Money (1990s – Present)

- Credit/debit cards, online banking, mobile payments.
- Introduction of digital payment platforms (e.g., PayPal, Alipay, Venmo).

## 9. Cryptocurrencies and Decentralized Money (2009 – Future)

- **2009**: Bitcoin, the first decentralized digital currency, launched by an anonymous entity (Satoshi Nakamoto).
- Blockchain-based currencies (e.g., Ethereum, Solana) enable programmable money.

**Features**
- No central authority.
- Transparency and immutability.
- Limited supply (for many coins).
- Introduced concepts like smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi).

# What Is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a type of blockchain—a decentralized digital network where computers around the world work together to store data and agree on its state. But unlike Bitcoin, which was designed mainly for sending and storing digital currency, Ethereum is designed to be a global computer: a platform where users can build and run applications that no single entity controls.

At the core of Ethereum is a special program called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It works like a global operating system that anyone can use. Developers can write and upload small pieces of code called smart contracts, which run automatically when certain conditions are met. These contracts are stored and executed on the blockchain, so no one can change or shut them down once they’re deployed.

## Why Ethereum Was Created

Bitcoin was the first decentralized currency, but it had a very limited scripting language—only allowing simple functions like sending coins or checking balances. Ethereum was created in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin to overcome these limitations. It allows for programmable logic on the blockchain, enabling decentralized applications (dApps) like:

- Financial tools (e.g., lending platforms)
- Games that run entirely on-chain
- Identity and voting systems

# Key Concepts Explained

## Blockchain

A blockchain is a digital ledger made up of blocks, each containing a list of transactions. Each block is linked to the one before it using cryptographic hashes, forming a secure chain. This structure makes it nearly impossible to tamper with the data once added.

## Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are programs that run automatically on Ethereum. They execute code exactly as written, without any possibility of censorship, downtime, or third-party interference. For example, a smart contract can be written to automatically transfer money from one user to another if certain conditions are met.

## Turing-Complete

Ethereum’s programming capabilities are Turing-complete, meaning you can write any logic you want—loops, conditions, storage—just like a normal programming language (e.g., Python or JavaScript). This allows for much more complex applications than Bitcoin.

## Decentralized

Ethereum is decentralized, which means there’s no central server or company running it. Instead, thousands of independent computers (called nodes) around the world run Ethereum software and maintain the blockchain together.

# Ethereum’s Major Upgrade: The Merge

Originally, Ethereum used a system called Proof-of-Work (PoW) to secure its network. This system required miners to use powerful computers to solve complex math problems. While effective, it was energy-intensive and less scalable.

**In September 2022**, Ethereum underwent a major upgrade called **The Merge**. This switched its consensus mechanism to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Instead of mining, now users can lock up (stake) their ETH coins to help secure the network. In return, they earn rewards. This upgrade reduced Ethereum's energy usage by more than 99% and paved the way for future scaling solutions.

# Understanding Consensus: PoW vs. PoS in Ethereum

In a decentralized blockchain like Ethereum, there is no central authority to decide which transactions are valid or which version of the blockchain is the "truth." Instead, a consensus mechanism is used to allow all participants in the network to agree on the current state of the blockchain. Ethereum has used two major consensus mechanisms in its history: Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS).

## What Is Proof-of-Work (PoW)?

Proof-of-Work is the original consensus mechanism used by Bitcoin and by Ethereum before The Merge. It is based on the idea of solving computational puzzles to gain the right to add a new block to the blockchain.

### How PoW Works (Step by Step):

1. Miners compete to solve a cryptographic puzzle. This involves finding a number called a nonce that, when combined with block data, produces a hash below a certain target (difficulty).
2. This process requires massive amounts of computation and energy, because miners must try millions of nonces per second.
3. The first miner to solve the puzzle broadcasts their block to the network.
4. Other nodes verify the block, and if valid, add it to their copy of the blockchain.
5. The winning miner is rewarded with newly minted ETH and transaction fees.

**Pros of PoW**
- Secure and well-tested.
- Resistant to certain types of attacks due to its high cost.

**Cons of PoW**
- Extremely energy-intensive.
- Hardware competition leads to centralization.
- Slow throughput and high fees during congestion.

## What Is Proof-of-Stake (PoS)?

Proof-of-Stake is a newer consensus mechanism that replaces computational work with economic stake.

### How PoS Works (Step by Step in Ethereum):

1. A validator must lock (stake) at least 32 ETH in a special smart contract.
2. The Ethereum protocol randomly selects validators to propose and attest to blocks.
3. Validators who propose valid blocks and attest honestly earn staking rewards.
4. Validators who try to cheat can be slashed—losing part or all of their staked ETH.
5. Finality is achieved through a protocol called Casper FFG.

**Pros of PoS**
- Energy-efficient.
- Lowers hardware barriers.
- Easier to scale for long-term upgrades.

**Cons of PoS**
- Complex validator behavior.
- Wealth concentration.
- Newer and less battle-tested.

## Ethereum’s Transition: From PoW to PoS

- Ethereum launched in 2015 with PoW.
- PoS was introduced through the Beacon Chain in 2020.
- **The Merge** (Sept 15, 2022) merged the execution layer and Beacon Chain.
- Mining stopped entirely; staking took over.
- Energy usage dropped by over **99.95%**.
- Enabled scalability features like **danksharding** and **proto-danksharding** (EIP-4844).

# Smart Contracts in Ethereum

Smart contracts in Ethereum are self-executing pieces of code stored on the Ethereum blockchain. They automatically enforce and execute the terms of an agreement when predefined conditions are met.

## 🔹 Core Characteristics
- **Deterministic**: Always produces the same output for the same input.
- **Immutable**: Cannot be changed once deployed.
- **Transparent**: Code and state are public.
- **Trustless**: No central authority needed.

## 🔹 Structure and Lifecycle
- **Development**: Written in Solidity.
- **Compilation**: Compiled to EVM bytecode.
- **Deployment**: Sent to blockchain via transaction.
- **Execution**: Triggered by transactions.

# Solidity Code Example: Simple Staking Contract 
This is a simplified staking contract to demonstrate the idea of staking ETH. In real Ethereum, staking is handled by the protocol itself, not a smart contract, but this example shows the core logic.


~~~~solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract SimpleStaking {
    address public owner;
    uint public totalStaked;

    mapping(address => uint) public stakes;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    // Stake ETH into the contract
    function stake() external payable {
        require(msg.value > 0, "Must send ETH to stake");
        stakes[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        totalStaked += msg.value;
    }

    // Withdraw staked ETH
    function withdraw(uint amount) external {
        require(stakes[msg.sender] >= amount, "Not enough staked");
        stakes[msg.sender] -= amount;
        totalStaked -= amount;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    }

    // View stake balance
    function getMyStake() external view returns (uint) {
        return stakes[msg.sender];
    }
}

~~~~


Explanation:
stake(): Users send ETH to the contract, which increases their stake.

withdraw(): Users can withdraw their stake at any time (unlike Ethereum PoS, which requires exit queues and delays).

This does not handle slashing, validator selection, or block rewards. In Ethereum PoS, these are managed at the protocol level via the Beacon Chain and Ethereum clients.
